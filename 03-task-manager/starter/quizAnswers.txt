1) Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
Middleware in Express are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 
These functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, adding response headers, etc.
Middleware can be added to an Express application using the app.use() method or by specifying middleware functions directly within route handlers. 
Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are added to the application.
2) What does CRUD stand for?
The acronym stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete — representing the four main operations performed on data. 
3) You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    a) How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
    In my application, I utilize the 'dotenv' package to access variables from the .env file. 
    This package automatically reads the .env file upon configuration, making the declared variables globally accessible throughout the application via the process.env object. 
    b)How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
    To safeguard the .env file and prevent it from being added to GitHub repository, you should include the .env file in the .gitignore configuration. 
    This effectively instructs Git to disregard the .env file when you commit changes.
